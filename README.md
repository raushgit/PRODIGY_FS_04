## ðŸš€ About the Project

The project is a real-time chat app. It helped me explore websocket.
## How it works

The users have conversations and groups. They also have a profile to manage their information.

So how it works! Their are user, conversation, group and message models. The user can search a friend already on the app with its mail. Their conversation is then added and they can receive messages from each other using the websocket. The messages can be text, images or even videos. The messages are also saved so that the users can access the chat history.

Groups can also be created with more than 2 users if needed! It enable communication between much more users on the same subject.
## Hope you enjoy
